## Posit table contest submission by Grant Chalmers.

Data for this table comes from [Electricity Maps](https://app.electricitymaps.com/map). This project aims to provide a free, open-source, and transparent visualisation of the carbon intensity of electricity consumption around the world. Please see [here](https://www.electricitymaps.com/methodology?utm_source=app.electricitymaps.com&utm_medium=referral#introduction) if you are interested in how Electricity Maps:

-   Collect data - data sources (how they verify and collect data)
-   Handle missing data - estimation models
-   Compute CO2 emissions - Carbon intensity and emission factors
-   Process data from collection to carbon intensity calculation.
